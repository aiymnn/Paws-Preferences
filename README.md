A fun and simple single-page web app that helps users discover their favorite types of cats â€” inspired by swipe-based interfaces like dating apps!

Built with **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite**, this app presents users with a series of cat images from the [Cataas API](https://cataas.com/). Users can swipe or tap buttons to **like** or **dislike** each cat. Once all cats are rated, the app displays a summary and the liked cats in a responsive grid.

## âœ¨ Features

- Swipe left/right or use buttons to rate cats
- Smooth transition animations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Summary of liked cats with image gallery
- Powered by [Cataas](https://cataas.com/) â€” Cat as a Service
